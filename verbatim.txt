Hi Simona, are you able to share any context about this tweet? Has something happened?

2018-09-19 18:38
@ScottmStedman
Hello Simona. I'm very interested in interviewing you and George. I'm local in Southern California, willing to meet you guys anywhere.

2018-09-20 17:32
@SimonaMangiante
Hi Scott, thanks for your interest. What's the interview for?

2018-09-20 18:13
@ScottmStedman
Hey there. it's just for my independent journalism. I have a bunch of questions about Mifsud, Tawil, Millian and others that the media isn't asking you guys about.

2018-09-20 18:14
@SimonaMangiante
You are spreading a lot of fantasies. Groundless false allegations. Thanks but we only meet serious journalists not fantasists news fabricators

2018-09-20 18:16
@ScottmStedman
This is why I want the questions answered fairly. I want to give you an opportunity to respond.

2018-09-20 18:17
@SimonaMangiante
Too late. You first defame me/us with false allegations and ONLY AFTER that you want to give me the opportunity to answer? normally it works the other way round eventully. Good luck

2018-09-20 18:19
@ScottmStedman
I didn't allege anything, just asked questions. I'm looking for the truth.

2018-09-20 18:28
@SimonaMangiante
Good luck! You seem to be too confused and brainwashed to even get close to the truth. George was set up. This is the truth

2018-09-27 16:25
@ScottmStedman
Have you ever met Stephan Roh?

2018-09-27 17:01
@SimonaMangiante
No
Why?

2018-09-27 17:01
@ScottmStedman
I'm wondering how you knew he's the money behind mifsud?

2018-09-27 18:11
@SimonaMangiante
Other Italian connection told me that roh employed mifsud and Co own link campus.
Common Contact

2018-09-27 18:14
@ScottmStedman
Understood. So do you think Roh is Western Intelligence too?

2018-09-28 00:17
@SimonaMangiante
Why would I think that roh is some sort of intelligence based only on the fact that he worked with mifsud?

2018-09-27 00:31
@ScottmStedman
He funded Mifsud.. Surely the funder of a western intelligence agent is also involved in intelligence

2018-09-28 02:25
@SimonaMangiante
Maybe

2018-09-28 02:27
@SimonaMangiante
It's not an evidence and not the point. Who cares if Stephen roh is an agent? We have many other evidences that link mifsud to mi6 and western intelligence.
Why focusing on roh?

2018-09-28 10:08
@ScottmStedman
Thanks. I hope we can continue to communicate and I apologize if I've come off as rude. I'm only interested in the facts and trying my best to find those.

2018-09-28 10:28
@ScottmStedman
Can I ask you how George knew Roh and why he Skyped him in 2017?

2018-09-28 13:06
@ScottmStedman
Weren't you with him at the time?

2018-09-28 13:21
@SimonaMangiante
Why you ask me what George did? He has his own twitter and he decides if he wants to answer yourquestions. As I told you I don't know

2018-09-28 13:22
@ScottmStedman
I've tweeted at him and emailed him but he doesn't seem to want to talk. I just read Roh's book which is why I have these questions

2018-10-02 19:00
@ScottmStedman
Simona I am working on a story. I'm requesting comment on the following questions.

1. How old are you? Why are there differing stories about your age?
2. What part of London did you live in 2016?
3. Why were you let go from the European Parliament?
4. How did you afford to live in late 2016?

2018-10-03 01:06
@SimonaMangiante
My personal details and in particular my address in London are nobody's business (it belongs to my privacy), people speculation about my birthday concerns only them. I share my passport details and birth certificate for legitimate purposes and not to feed anyone curiosity. I don't care if people say I am 20 or 40. Concerning my job at the European Parliament I was temporary agent of the European union and not a permanent member of the staff, which means my contract had an expiration date, and I left because my contract expired on 31 August 2016.
Additionally I filed a complaint against the EU because their opaque practices in the office I used to work for ( international child Abductions) which I am in the process to expose. When I left the EU, I worked shortly For the London center of international law practice ( 3 months) I quitted because of the reasons I clarified many times to reporters. How did I support myself after? I am an attorney and I have been working on cases of child abductions as my own practice, I am also the spokeswoman for an association of parents in Europe and this Brought to me a lot of work ( while I was based in London) I am an attorney, specialized in international law and European law. you can watch my interview at Rai television where I was invited in representation of my client on March 2017. Hope you have a better understanding of my background. best

2018-10-03 10:31
@ScottmStedman
Thank you for the thorough response. Couple of quick follow ups.

1. What year(s) did you work for Mayer Brown?
2. Can you describe a little bit about what you mean about opaque practices at the European Parliament?

2018-10-03 10:49
@ScottmStedman
Oops, I think I just answered number 1 myself. Your linkedin says 2007-2008, is that right?

2018-10-03 11:31
@SimonaMangiante
Yes 2007. The vice president in charge of the office - managed it for her personal purpose - to hire not qualified friends and family, regardless of the public nature of the service - with the connvinience of the Secretary General - who would allow that.
Child abductions are a sensitive issue, they involve human life' of sensitive categories children, to be used as a tool to Employ a secretary ( among others) with the tasks of a lawyer - the public was very disappointed. It's a long story

2018-10-03 11:33
@SimonaMangiante
I was a summer associate in Washington for Mayer and brown, on 2007 - John Schmitz, was my mentor. Than I went to New York where I worked for the same law firm ( I was junior associate/ trainee) at the department of finance

2018-10-03 10:39
@ScottmStedman
Thank you Simona!

2018-10-03 12:14
@SimonaMangiante
The vicepresident in charge replaced many people in the office ( including me) with her friends- the worst part is that those friends were unqualified. This didn't affect my job for the EP, which was linked to my contract expiration date, I was appointed to the JURI parliamentary commette after what with exactly the same salary- so my protest is for public concerns not personal ones

2018-10-03 12:22
@ScottmStedman
What was the reason for replacing you?? Seems unfair

2018-10-03 12:14
@SimonaMangiante
It is unfair considered I was a reference in the field. I also contributed to write a model of law on child protection with the Joh Hopkins university based on my work there. The reason was for Maired McGuinness to give a job to her Irish family friend, Irene Hennigan, and her possibilities to do so were limited to this office. IRENE was administratively a part time temporary AST ( secretary), with a contract of 6 months. The only opportunity to help Irene for McGuinness was to give her my job. The mediation office was literally composed by 2 people a manager legal advisor ( by contrast must be a lawyer)(me) and an assistant. She replaced the lawyer with the assistant and gave her tasks she was unqualified for. All this with the connivence of the asministration. That's why I filed a lawsuit that I am winning by the way
